# VBA.Round

Superior functions for:

* Rounding Currency, Decimal, and Double up, down, by 4/5, or to a specified count of significant figures
* Rounding \(and scaling\) all items of a series of numbers to have the sum to match a desired rounded total

In many areas, rounding that accurately follows specific rules are needed - accounting, statistics, insurance, etc.

Unfortunately, the native functions of VBA that can perform rounding are either missing, limited, inaccurate, or buggy, and all address only a single rounding method. The upside is that they are fast, and that may in some situations be important.

However, often precision is mandatory, and with the speed of computers today, a little slower processing will hardly be noticed, indeed not for processing of single values. All the functions presented here run at about 1 Âµs.

They cover the normal rounding methods:

* Round down, with the option to round negative values towards zero

* Round up, with the option to round negative values away from zero

* Round by 4/5, either away from zero or to even  \(Banker's Rounding\)

* Round to a count of significant figures

The first three functions accept all the numeric data types.  
The last exists in three varieties - for Currency, Decimal, and Double respectively.

They all accept a specified count of decimals - including a negative count which will round to tens, hundreds, etc. Those with Variant as return type will return _Null _for incomprehensible input.
